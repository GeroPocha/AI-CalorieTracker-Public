# 🍽️ AI-Powered Nutrition Tracker  

This is the **frontend** for my AI-powered calorie tracking system, built with (and hosted on) **Lovable** for a clean and interactive design. The system allows seamless food logging via **voice input** or **barcode scanning**, using AI to extract calorie and macronutrient data, which is stored in **Supabase** and displayed in a **real-time dashboard**.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Tell Siri what you ate** (e.g., “I had 100g of yogurt”).  
2️⃣ The **Perplexity API** calculates the **calories & macros**.  
3️⃣ Data is stored in **Supabase** via an automated **n8n workflow**.  
4️⃣ The **Lovable frontend** displays real-time progress and insights.  
5️⃣ For branded products like frozen fries, **scan the barcode** instead!
