# üçΩÔ∏è AI-Powered Nutrition Tracker  

This is the **frontend** for my AI-powered calorie tracking system, built with (and hosted on) **Lovable** for a clean and interactive design. The system allows seamless food logging via **voice input** or **barcode scanning**, using AI to extract calorie and macronutrient data, which is stored in **Supabase** and displayed in a **real-time dashboard**.

## üöÄ How It Works  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Tell Siri what you ate** (e.g., ‚ÄúI had 100g of yogurt‚Äù).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **Perplexity API** calculates the **calories & macros**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data is stored in **Supabase** via an automated **n8n workflow**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The **Lovable frontend** displays real-time progress and insights.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ For branded products like frozen fries, **scan the barcode** instead!

### **n8n Workflow**  
- **Automation Workflow:** ![image](/public/N8N%20Flow.jpg)

The **n8n workflow** automates the entire process, making calorie tracking effortless. It consists of **two separate paths**, each triggered by a different **iOS shortcut**:

1. **Speech / Text Input Path**: This workflow is triggered when you **tell Siri what you ate**. It sends the input to **Perplexity API**, which returns the calories and macronutrient breakdown. The response is then processed and stored in **Supabase**.

2. **Barcode Scanning Path**: When scanning a barcode on your Iphone, the label is read and processed via the **Open Food Facts API**, the workflow retrieves the nutritional data for the exact product scanned. The extracted information is processed and saved in **Supabase**.

Both paths merge into a final **Supabase storage step**, ensuring all meal logs are available in the **interactive dashboard**. The final response is sent back via a webhook, providing immediate feedback if needed.
